GRU-Based Fake News Detection

📌 Project Overview
This project is a deep learning model for fake news detection using a **Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)** network. The model is trained to classify news articles as **real or fake** based on textual content.

📂 Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation is available on **Kaggle**:
🔗 [Fake News Dataset](<https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emineyetm/fake-news-detection-datasets/data>)

Make sure to download the dataset and place it in the appropriate directory before running the notebook.
